A businessman runs a supermarket chain that has a headquarter in Nairobi and four other branches in 
Kisumu, Mombasa, Nakuru and Eldoret. The supermarket sells soft drinks. A customer can buy drinks from 
any branch including the headquarter. All drinks retail at the same price. A customer can buy drinks from 
any branch including the headquarter. Restocking of all the branches is done from the headquarter.  
You are required to develop a distributed Android application to enable the businessman to run his business 
seamlessly. In particular, a customer should be able to register and log into the system. Similarly, there 
should be an admin account through which restocking of the branches is done. The admin should also view 
a sale report of all the sales made from all the branches including the headquarter in terms of each brand of 
the drink sold, how much income each brand of drink generated and the grand total of the amount of money 
made from all sales. For the sake of the demonstration, the supermarket will be assumed to sell three types 
of drinks i.e Coke, Fanta and Sprite. 
When presenting this work, there must be four devices. The first device will be used by the admin while 
the other three devices will be used by the customers. Customers will be expected to log into different 
devices and make independent purchases from the branches. Each purchase will include actual payment 
via mpesa sandbox API. The admin will be expected to view the sale report from his/her device.
